Ocean exploration remains one of Earth's final frontiers. Scientists estimate that we have 
explored less than five percent of the world's oceans. Deep-sea submersibles are discovering 
bizarre creatures that thrive in extreme conditions near hydrothermal vents. Coral reefs, 
often called the rainforests of the sea, support incredible biodiversity but face threats 
from warming waters and pollution. Marine biology research is uncovering compounds from 
sea organisms that show promise for developing new medicines. Protecting ocean ecosystems 
is crucial for maintaining the health of our entire planet.
