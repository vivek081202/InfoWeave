Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational power and problem-solving 
capabilities. Unlike classical computers that use bits representing zeros and ones, quantum 
computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through superposition. 
This allows quantum computers to process complex calculations exponentially faster than 
traditional systems. Potential applications include drug discovery, financial modeling, 
climate prediction, and cryptography. Tech giants and research institutions are racing to 
achieve quantum supremacy and develop practical quantum computers that can solve real-world 
problems.
