Sustainable agriculture practices aim to produce food while minimizing environmental 
impact and preserving resources for future generations. Crop rotation maintains soil 
health and reduces pest problems without excessive pesticide use. Precision farming 
techniques use GPS technology and data analytics to optimize irrigation, fertilization, 
and harvesting, reducing waste and improving yields. Organic farming eliminates synthetic 
chemicals, promoting soil biodiversity and producing healthier food. Vertical farming in 
urban areas maximizes space efficiency and reduces transportation costs. These approaches 
demonstrate that agricultural productivity and environmental stewardship can coexist.
