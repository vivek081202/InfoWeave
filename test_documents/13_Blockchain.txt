Blockchain technology extends far beyond cryptocurrency applications. This distributed 
ledger system provides transparent, tamper-proof record-keeping that can revolutionize 
supply chain management, voting systems, and digital identity verification. Smart contracts 
automatically execute agreements when predetermined conditions are met, eliminating the 
need for intermediaries and reducing transaction costs. Major corporations are exploring 
blockchain implementations to improve efficiency, reduce fraud, and increase transparency 
in their operations. However, scalability and energy consumption remain significant 
challenges that developers must address.
