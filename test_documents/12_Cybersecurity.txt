Cybersecurity threats are evolving rapidly in our increasingly connected world. Ransomware 
attacks have become more sophisticated, targeting not only businesses but also critical 
infrastructure like hospitals and power grids. Hackers employ social engineering tactics 
to trick employees into revealing sensitive information or installing malicious software. 
Organizations must implement multi-layered security strategies including firewalls, 
encryption, intrusion detection systems, and regular security audits. Employee training 
is crucial as human error remains one of the weakest links in cybersecurity defenses.
