Fitness trends continuously evolve, reflecting changing preferences and scientific 
understanding of exercise physiology. High-intensity interval training (HIIT) has gained 
popularity for its efficiency in burning calories and improving cardiovascular fitness in 
short workout sessions. Functional fitness emphasizes movements that translate to daily 
activities rather than isolated muscle training. Mind-body practices like yoga and Pilates 
combine physical exercise with mental wellness benefits. Boutique fitness studios offer 
specialized, community-focused workout experiences. Fitness technology including smart 
watches and connected equipment provides real-time performance feedback and motivation.
