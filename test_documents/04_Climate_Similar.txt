Global warming is among the biggest threats to human civilization in modern times. 
Increasing temperatures worldwide are leading to melting polar ice, elevated ocean levels, 
and more erratic climate conditions. Researchers caution that failing to take urgent steps 
to decrease greenhouse gas emissions could result in disastrous outcomes such as severe 
water shortages, catastrophic flooding, and widespread loss of animal species. Nations and 
institutions need to collaborate on developing eco-friendly strategies and shifting toward 
clean energy alternatives.
