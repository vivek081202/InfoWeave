Renewable energy sources are becoming increasingly cost-competitive with fossil fuels. 
Solar panel efficiency has improved dramatically while manufacturing costs have plummeted, 
making solar power accessible to homeowners and businesses worldwide. Wind energy farms, 
both onshore and offshore, generate clean electricity at scale. Battery storage technology 
advances are solving the intermittency problem associated with renewable sources. Governments 
are implementing incentives and regulations to accelerate the transition to clean energy. 
However, grid infrastructure must be upgraded to handle distributed renewable generation 
and maintain reliability.
