Sports analytics has revolutionized how teams evaluate players, develop strategies, and 
make decisions. Advanced statistics go beyond traditional metrics to measure player 
efficiency, court or field positioning, and situational performance. Video analysis 
software breaks down player movements frame by frame, identifying areas for technique 
improvement. Wearable sensors track athlete biometrics during training and competition, 
helping optimize performance and prevent injuries. Teams employ data scientists and 
statistical analysts to gain competitive advantages. However, some argue that excessive 
reliance on analytics overlooks intangible qualities like leadership and team chemistry.
