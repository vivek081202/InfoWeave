Electronic commerce has revolutionized retail and consumer behavior. Online marketplaces 
enable businesses to reach global customers without physical storefronts. Mobile shopping 
apps provide convenient purchasing experiences with personalized recommendations based on 
browsing history and preferences. Social media platforms have integrated shopping features, 
blurring the lines between social networking and e-commerce. Supply chain innovations and 
sophisticated logistics networks enable rapid delivery, with same-day shipping becoming 
increasingly common in urban areas. Traditional retailers must adapt or face obsolescence 
in this digital marketplace.
