The French Revolution, which began in 1789, fundamentally transformed European political 
and social structures. The revolution emerged from widespread dissatisfaction with the 
absolute monarchy, economic inequality, and the privileges enjoyed by the nobility and 
clergy. The storming of the Bastille on July 14, 1789, symbolized the people's uprising 
against royal authority. Revolutionary leaders like Maximilien Robespierre advocated for 
radical changes including the abolition of feudalism and the establishment of a republic. 
The revolution's ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity influenced democratic movements 
worldwide for centuries to come.
