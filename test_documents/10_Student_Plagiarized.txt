The French Revolution started in 1789 and fundamentally transformed European political 
and social structures. This revolution emerged from widespread dissatisfaction with the 
absolute monarchy, economic inequality, and the privileges enjoyed by nobility and clergy. 
When the Bastille was stormed on July 14, 1789, it symbolized the uprising of people 
against royal authority. Revolutionary leaders such as Maximilien Robespierre advocated 
for radical changes including abolition of feudalism and establishment of a republic. 
Revolutionary ideals of liberty, equality, and fraternity influenced democratic movements 
worldwide for centuries.
