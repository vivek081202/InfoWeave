Beginning in 1789, France experienced a revolutionary period that dramatically altered 
European governance and social systems. This upheaval stemmed from public frustration 
with monarchical absolutism, wealth disparity, and aristocratic advantages. The symbolic 
attack on the Bastille fortress represented popular resistance to monarchical power. 
Political figures like Robespierre championed sweeping reforms, including ending feudal 
systems and creating republican governance. These revolutionary principles subsequently 
inspired liberation movements across the globe throughout the following two centuries.
